*** Extra error cases are found, accounted for, and called out in code comments.

1. Fixed Navigation issues.  The app, as provided, had many navigation quirks.  The back buttons did not work correctly.  In some cases, content
from two fragments would appear on top of each other, etc.  Fixed so that the List of Books, Scan Book, and About pages are all "Top Level".  Pressing the back button from any one of these closes the app.  On non-tablets, the book details page opens in it's own page.  Pressing the back button from here returns to the List of Books page.  This make Navigation much cleaner. 
2. Fixed app crashes when rotating the device with book details showing.
3. Fixed book details still showing when the user selects the About or Scan pages in tablet mode.
4. Fixed NullPointerException if the book does not have an author. (i.e. Reference books)
5. Added Toast informing user when there is no network connectivity.
6. Added Toast when an invalid ISBN number is entered.
 
*** zxing integration notes.

1.  Clone the zxing project from https://github.com/zxing/zxing
2.  Build the zxing projects.
    Use "maven -DskipTests=true package"
3.  In Android Studio, open the alexandria project.
4.  Select File -> New -> New Module
5.  Select "Phone and Tablet Application" / "Import Existing Project"
6.  Import the zxing/android project.  Change the module name from android to something like zxing_android.
7.  A new module should appear named "zxing_android"
8.  Copy the zxing/android-core/target/android-core-3.2.1-SNAPSHOT.jar file to the zxing_android/libs directory.  This .jar file contains the CameraConfigurationUtils class that will otherwise be missing.
9.  Open the zxing_android library's Module Settings, and add the android-core jar file to the Dependencies tab.
10. Test the module by running com.google.zxing.client.android.CaptureActivity
11. open the app's Module Settings, and add the zxing_android module as a dependency.
12. Edit the zxing_android project's build.gradle file,
    - Change the line "apply plugin: 'com.android.application'" to "apply plugin: 'com.android.library'"
    This fixes the erorr message "Error: Dependency alexandria:zxing_android:unspecified on project app resolves to an APK archive which is not supported as a compilation dependency..."
    - Remove the line "applicationId "com.google.zxing.client.android"
13. Go through the zxing_android library and replace all switch blocks that use R with the equivalent if-then-else blocks.
14. Remove android:icon, android:logo, and intent-filter MAIN/LAUNCHER from zxing_android/AndroidManifest.xml
